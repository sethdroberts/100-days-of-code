# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added tags, removed status, due, next action, and categories. Redesigned the backdrop and show/edit page, and added JS functionality to make new/update functions much cleaner (no separate pages).

**Thoughts:** CSS is a pain to figure out, but everything else was pretty straightforward. Integrating AJAX is going to be the next main technical challenge.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
