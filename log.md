# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added tags, removed status, due, next action, and categories. Redesigned the backdrop and show/edit page, and added JS functionality to make new/update functions much cleaner (no separate pages).

**Thoughts:** CSS is a pain to figure out, but everything else was pretty straightforward. Integrating AJAX is going to be the next main technical challenge.


### Day 2: October 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up a Docker container so I can do all my development on my computer in an environment instead of being stuck with Cloud9 and its memory/Internet issues.

**Thoughts**: This was pretty fun to set up, but I'm stuck on getting rails or node server to start with localhost through the docker container.

### Day 3: October 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Redesigned the dashboard layout to be more user-friendly. Figured out what I wanted on it, and added dummy text while I build tag and task controllers with AJAX.

**Thoughts**: Wasn't any big technical challenge, but it was nice to get a feel for what the dashboard should look like design-wise, and to see it in real life before I code it up.

### Day 4: October 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the tagging and search setup, so now I can assign tags to all interests, and easily select by tag if I need to look for specific tags. Weaknesses is that there's no direct delete function and it's a little clumsy to enter new tags. But it's all there if you use it carefully.

**Thoughts**: This was pretty technically challenging to implement, but [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPpigFAlLmE) on adding tags to posts via hashtags helped a lot. Had to learn some [Regex](https://regexr.com/), which was painful, but very rewarding once I figured it out.
